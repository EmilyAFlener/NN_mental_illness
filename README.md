# Neural Networks and Mental Illness 

As an individual with lived experience with mental illness, the mechanisms that manifest symptoms and produce these illnesses fascinates me. During my [Lambda School Data Science coursework](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science) on deep learning neural networks I couldn't help but question the parallels between this machine learning tool and mental illness symptoms. Thus, I started this project to quench my curiosity. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!


[IBM's definition of neural networks:](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/neural-networks) neural networks reflect the behavior of the human brain, allowing computer programs to recognize patterns and solve common problems in the fields of AI, machine learning, and deep learning.

[The American National Institute of Mental Health's definition of mental illness:](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness) any mental illness (AMI) is defined as mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder. AMI can vary in impact, ranging from no impairment to mild, moderate, and even severe impairment.


## Project Considerations

### Considerations

The origins of mental illness is complicated and multi-disciplniary thus making this project a qualitative exploration unable to produce statistical results. [The American National Institute of Health summarizes this well stating:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234144/) 'neuroscience has begun to uncover some of the intricate and less obvious relations between the mind and the brain, as investigative approaches from biochemistry, psychology, and genetics converge on an understanding of the physiology of mental illness.'


## Scientific Method

For this project, I will use the [Brittanica Encyclopedia definition of the scientific method](https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-method) to organize my exploration in a quasi scientific way.

### Observation

Deep learning neural networks mirror the human brain and have erros and flaws.
The human brains natural flaws manifest as mental illnesses, neorological disorders or developmental disorders.

### Question

If deep learning neural networks mimic the brain, do their errors also mimic mental illness?

### Experiementation

Test by mapping mental illness mechanisms and behaviors to corresponding deep neural network functional and and visualizations errors.

### Analysis

Will know if there are similarities between the two if a deep learning neural network error mirrors a mental illness's symptoms.

### Conclusion

Let's find out!
