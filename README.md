# Neural Networks and Mental Illness 


Per IBM: Neural networks reflect the behavior of the human brain, allowing computer programs to recognize patterns and solve common problems in the fields of AI, machine learning, and deep learning.


## Project Considerations

### Considerations

The origins of mental illness is complicated and multi-disciplniary thus making this project a qualitative exploration unable to produce statistical results. [The American National Institute of Health summarizes this well stating:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234144/) 'neuroscience has begun to uncover some of the intricate and less obvious relations between the mind and the brain, as investigative approaches from biochemistry, psychology, and genetics converge on an understanding of the physiology of mental illness.'


## Scientific Method

For this project, I will use the [Brittanica Encyclopedia definition of the scientific method](https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-method) to organize the exploration in a quasi scientific way.

### Observation

Deep nearning neural networks mirror the human brain and have erros and flaws.
The human brains natural flaws  manifest as mental illnesses, neoroligal disorders or developmental disorders.

### Question

If deep learning neural networks mimic the brain, do their errors also mimic mental illness?

### Experiementation

Test by mapping mental illness mechanisms and behaviors to corresponding deep neural network errors and visualizations.

### Analysis

Will know if there are similarities between the two if a deep learning neural network error mirros a mental illness symptom.

### Conclusion

Let's find out!
