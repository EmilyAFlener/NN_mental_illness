# Neural Networks and Mental Illness 
Research mapping neural networks and mental illness.

As IBM defines it: Neural networks reflect the behavior of the human brain, allowing computer programs to recognize patterns and solve common problems in the fields of AI, machine learning, and deep learning.


## [Scientific Method](https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-method)

### Observation

### Question


### Hypothesis: If deep learning neural networks mimic the brain, do their errors also mimic mental illness?

### Experiementation

### Analysis

### Conclusion
Because mental illnesses still have various unknowns 
Tested by mapping mental illness mechanisms and behaviors to corresponding neural network errors
