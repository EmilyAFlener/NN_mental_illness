# Neural Networks and Mental Illness 

As an individual with a mental illness lived experience, the mechanisms that manifest symptoms and produce these illnesses fascinates me. During my [Lambda School Data Science coursework](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/data-science) on deep learning neural networks I couldn't help but question the parallels between this machine learning tool and mental illness symptoms. Thus, I started this project to quench my curiosity. I hope you enjoy it as much as I am!

# Overview

I recommend exploring the repo Wiki to establish the foundational elements of this project.

### Observation

Deep learning neural networks mirror the human brain and have erros and flaws.
The human brain's natural flaws manifest as mental illnesses, neorological disorders or developmental disorders.

### Question

If deep learning neural networks mimic the brain, do their errors also mimic mental illness?

### Experimentation

Test by mapping mental illness mechanisms and behaviors to corresponding deep neural network functional and visualizations errors.

### Analysis

Will know if there are similarities between the two if a deep learning neural network error mirrors a mental illness's symptoms.

### Conclusion

Let's find out!
